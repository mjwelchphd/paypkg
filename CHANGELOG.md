0.1.7
-----
* Changed the initialize method to pass the database extension (development, test, production), and the database (project) path name. This change was necessary in order to allow this gem to operate without Ruby on Rails.

Before: pp = Paypkg.new(session)

After: pp = Paypkg.new(session, Rails.env, Rails.root.to_path)

0.1.6
-----
* Changed the spelling of Polish currency to its US-ASCII equivalent to avoid getting the error 'invalid multibyte char' during require.

0.1.5
-----
* Moved the release date into the same file as the version so as not to forget to change it along with the version number.

0.1.4
-----
* Added a new method 'error_data' which returns a standardized error response.
  This method should only be called when 'call_paypal' returns false.

0.1.3
-----
* Removed unused parameter from accept_pp_payment.
* Added code to remove the uri_base from the link provided by PayPal
  after an authorization in 'validate-credit-card.rb'. Without this change,
  PayPal will now force close the connection resulting in a ECONNRESET error.
* Removed an unneeded debugging statement in 'lib/paypkg.rb'.

0.1.2
-----
* Exposed the json data (input) string as request, i.e.:
    pp = Paypkg.new status
    pp.some_call(...)
  r = pp.request # <-- this is the json string that was passed to PayPal.
  NOTE: it only has the request AFTER you call call_paypkg because
  paypkg puts the string into it when it's called so you can see what
  your input looked like after it was prepared to send to PayPal.
  Like json and hash, request is an array.
* Added retrieve_payment_resource(payment_id) for looking up payments.
* Updated paypkg_test.rb to test the new method above.
* Added a README.html because a text file just doesn't cut it.

0.1.1
-----
* Added PaypkgResponse, a class that converts a hash equivilent of the json output to an object.
  This will make it more compatible with existing code based on ActiveRecord.
* Added more documentation. See the README.md file.
* Split out all the PayPal functions into individual files so that new functions can be added
  without risking damaging anything. This also makes it easier to add new functions to the gem.
* Added a PaypkgTestController and a paypkg_test views folder that can be used for testing,
  and seeing how to use the package.

0.1.0
-----
* Created initial Pay Package gem and uploaded it to rubygems.org. There is no documentation yet.
